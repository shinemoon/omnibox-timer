# Omnibox Timer Again

Yet another quick timer tool for Chrome users, based on ***Omnibox Timer***

["Omnibox Timer"](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/iooaeaogjngpihndkcednkblomlkaaif) is so good extension, but with below restriction (Or indeed it's just author's own special flavor... I believe so.)

+ Can't support absolute time for reminder, e.g. `14:00 Call Mom`
+ Can't support combined way of configuration , e.g. `1h20m Go Home`
+ Can't cancel/stop ongoing timers
+ Help info is not so readable for newbie, especially if they don't have habit to read the webstore page 
+ Peronsally I am not so in favor of the page style of option page, icon and font, etc.... but just personally


That's the reason I fork and create the extension: https://github.com/shinemoon/omnibox-timer.git
